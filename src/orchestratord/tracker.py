"""Tracker adapter protocol for issue tracker backends.

The tracker layer is split into a **core contract** (``TrackerAdapter``,
methods every backend must implement) and **capability protocols**
(``PullRequestCapability``, ``LabelCapability``, ...) for optional feature
groups.  Callers must check ``supports(tracker, SomeCapability)`` before
invoking a capability method; unsupported trackers simply do not have the
method instead of returning a silent no-op.

This replaces the previous design where every optional method defaulted to
``None`` / ``False`` — callers could not distinguish "not supported" from
"failed".  The refactor assumes all adapters ship together in the same
release, so cross-version back-compat defaults are no longer needed.

This module is the single-file home of the adapter contract, the
normalized data models, and the capability protocols.  Two sibling
modules hold the rest of the former ``tracker.py`` contents and are
re-exported here for back-compat:

  - :mod:`extensions.orchestrator.intent` — ``Intent`` / ``Command``
    semantics, label/comment parsing, priority merging.
  - :mod:`extensions.orchestrator.tracker_kinds` — tracker kind registry,
    config validation, and the ``create_tracker_adapter`` factory.
