"""Repro-first gate — reproduce the bug before you may fix it.

Capability extension #1 (the keystone): a fix pipeline is only as
trustworthy as its ability to *observe* the defect. This module adds a
reproduction stage in front of the normal fix run:

1. A dedicated agent pass turns the issue description into an
   executable check: it writes reproduction assets under
   ``.orchestrator_control/repro/`` and puts a single shell command into
   ``repro_command.txt``. Contract: the command **exits non-zero while
   the bug exists and zero once it is fixed** (i.e. it is a failing
   test).
2. The orchestrator runs that command itself. Only a demonstrated
   failure opens the gate to the fix stage; the command is then re-run
   during pre-push verification and must have turned green.
3. When the agent cannot reproduce (or produced nothing executable),
   the gate closes: the issue is marked failed with a
   "cannot reproduce" report posted back to the tracker — instead of an
   unverifiable "fix" MR.

Everything lives under ``.orchestrator_control/`` so the existing
artifact guards keep reproduction scaffolding out of commits.

Your ONLY task is to turn the described problem into a repeatable,
executable check. Do NOT fix anything. Do NOT modify existing source
files.

1. Explore the repository and reproduce the described behavior.
2. Create your reproduction assets under `{REPRO_DIR}/` (e.g. a
   `repro_test.py` exercising the buggy behavior).
3. Write ONE shell command (a single line, run from the repository
   root) into `{REPRO_COMMAND_FILE}`. The command MUST:
   - exit with a NON-ZERO code right now (it demonstrates the bug), and
   - exit 0 once the bug is properly fixed.
   A failing test is the ideal shape for this command.
4. Run the command yourself and confirm it currently exits non-zero.

If you cannot reproduce the problem after honest attempts (the
referenced code does not exist, the described behavior is actually
correct, the steps are not actionable), write
`{NOT_REPRODUCIBLE_FILE}` instead:

```json
{{"reason": "<one line>",
  "attempts": ["<what you tried>", "..."]}}
```

Then stop. Never invent a reproduction for a bug you could not
actually observe — an honest "cannot reproduce" is a valid, useful
outcome.
