"""Pipeline mode — run an issue across N sequential agent stages.

A pipeline stage is one full ``AgentRunner.run`` invocation on the SAME
``AgentSession`` / workspace, scoped to a single named responsibility
(e.g. analyzer, implementer, tester). Between stages we:

* Reset the per-run scalars on the session (``turn_count``, ``status``,
  ``output_text``, ``session_end_reason``, ``session_end_summary``) so
  the next stage gets its full ``max_turns`` budget and isn't seen as
  "already completed".
* Force a fresh ``run_id`` so each stage's transcript ends up in its
  own ``~/.orchestratord/tool-events/<run_id>/events.ndjson`` directory —
  this is what gives ops people separate audit trails per stage.
* Reset the 429 backoff counters so a rate-limit episode in stage 1
  doesn't doom stage 2 to skip its first turn.

The previous stage's tail-truncated output is injected into the next
stage's ``prompt_override`` as handoff context. We keep the tail (last
N chars) instead of a head/middle slice because LLM outputs typically
end with the actionable conclusion / summary; older context that the
model would still need is recoverable from the workspace files.

This implementation runs stages SERIALLY on the same workspace. For
truly parallel pipeline stages — useful when stages produce independent
side outputs — see ``CoordinatorModeRunner`` in Phase 3.

        * ``stage_model`` — only when non-empty **AND different from the
          current value** (avoids noisy "overriding X → X" no-op log lines).
        * ``stage_max_turns`` — only when configured and > 0. Mutates
          ``agent_runner.max_turns`` directly because AgentRunner captures
          max_turns at __init__ from agent_config (not per-run).
        * ``CLAUDE_CODE_AGENT_NAME`` — only when ``set_agent_name=True``
          (mailbox handoff needs it; prompt-only handoff shouldn't touch
          the shared env because other issues on the same daemon might
          be using it).

        Each swap tracks its own ``_touched_*`` flag so ``__exit__`` only
        restores what ``__enter__`` actually changed.
