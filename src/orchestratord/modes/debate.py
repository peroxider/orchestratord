"""Debate mode — N independent proposers + 1 judge picks the winner.

Pipeline vs Debate (why a separate runner)
------------------------------------------

Pipeline injects EVERY prior stage's output into the next stage's prompt
so each stage builds on its predecessors. Debate is the opposite: each
proposer must think *independently* — its prompt deliberately omits the
other proposers' outputs so we get two unbiased takes the judge can
compare.

Stages
------

``proposer_a`` → ``proposer_b`` → ``judge`` (default; ``proposers`` is configurable)

* Each ``proposer_*`` is told to **not edit code** — they produce a
  written design proposal only. The judge implements the winning
  proposal.
* The judge sees both proposals verbatim in its prompt, picks one with
  a short justification, then implements it.

Why proposers run sequentially (not in parallel)
------------------------------------------------

True parallel proposers would each need their own worktree — Phase 3
keeps things simple and reuses the single session/workspace. Sequential
proposers still work because the prompt explicitly forbids reading the
prior proposer's mailbox / output. The first-mover advantage is
acknowledged and intentional for Phase 3; Phase 4 (out of scope) would
split worktrees.

Session-state handling
----------------------

Same as :class:`PipelineModeRunner`: reset ``turn_count`` / ``status`` /
``output_text`` / ``run_id`` between stages so each one gets a clean
``AgentRunner.run`` invocation with its own transcript + max_turns.
