"""ModeRunner Protocol + ModeDecision dataclass.

Why a Protocol instead of an ABC
--------------------------------

Phase 1 deliberately matches the existing ``AgentRunner.run`` shape
duck-typed in ``orchestrator.py:1579``: any object exposing an awaitable
``run(session, workflow, **hooks)`` works there. Keeping ``ModeRunner``
as a ``Protocol`` means ``SingleModeRunner`` can be a one-line wrapper
and the orchestrator's call site stays unchanged — we just dispatch
through ``modes.get(mode_key)`` first instead of taking
``self.agent_runner`` directly.

Future modes (Pipeline / Coordinator / Debate) implement the same
``run(...)`` signature but internally orchestrate multiple agent runs.

    Attributes
    ----------
    mode
        The collaboration mode key (e.g. ``"single"``, ``"pipeline"``,
        ``"coordinator"``, ``"debate"``).
    reason
        Human-readable explanation of why this mode was picked. Persisted
        to ``IssueRecord.mode_decision_reason`` so operators can audit
        router decisions later.
    source
        Where the decision came from:
        ``"label"`` — explicit ``mode:*`` label on the issue
        ``"router"`` — LLM router agent picked it
        ``"fallback"`` — selector failed; using ``DEFAULT_MODE``
        ``"config"`` — workflow.md forced a mode for all issues
    agents
        Optional roster of role names the mode expects (used by Pipeline
        and Debate). Phase-1 leaves this empty for ``single``.
    confidence
        Router's self-reported confidence (``0.0``–``1.0``). Phase-1
        modes ignore this; future code may threshold on it.
