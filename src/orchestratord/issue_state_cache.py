"""Per-session cache for ``AgentRunner._should_continue`` polling.

Decouples the skip decision from the agent runner so the orchestrator
can call :class:`IssueStateCache` independently and so unit tests can
exercise the cache without spinning up the full agent loop.

The cache is *per-session*: each :class:`orchestratord.agent_runner.AgentSession`
gets its own instance at construction time. Two concurrent sessions
never share state. The cache is also *per-issue-id*: a single session
running against one issue maintains a single history list.

Skip policy
-----------
``should_skip_poll(issue_id, turn)`` returns ``True`` iff ALL of:

- ``stable_skip_turns > 0`` (configurable knob — set to 0 disables the
  cache entirely and the runner always polls);
- the last ``stable_skip_turns`` recorded snapshots are all
  ``is_active=True``;
- the last ``stable_skip_turns`` recorded snapshots all share the same
  ``state`` value;
- those snapshots span ``stable_skip_turns`` *consecutive* turns
  ending at ``turn - 1`` (gaps force a re-poll — defensive against
  silent polling skips caused by upstream 429 backoff or other turn
  pauses);
- :meth:`has_recent_inactive` is ``False`` for ``turn - 1`` (an
  inactive issue must always be re-confirmed before declaring the
  loop done).

Invalidation
------------
:meth:`invalidate` clears entries. Callers should invoke it from:

- agent_runner user-interrupt handlers;
- external state mutation callbacks (operator label, manual issue
  close, etc.);
- whenever a freshly-fetched snapshot reports ``is_active=False``
  (the next call must re-confirm anyway).

Thread safety
-------------
The cache is mutated only from the orchestrator's async task driving
the session. ``asyncio`` serialises that single task, so no lock is
needed. Concurrent reads from logging paths are safe because the data
structures are simple dict/list operations.
