"""Issue premise validation + honest-exit channel.

Two closed loops that were missing from the fix pipeline:

1. **Premise check** — issues frequently claim "file X crashes at line
   N"; when X does not exist in the repository the claim is unverifiable
   and the correct behavior is to say so, not to invent X. This module
   extracts path-like references from the issue text and reports which
   ones are absent from the workspace so the prompt can warn the agent
   *before* it starts working.

2. **Honest exit** — the only terminal outcomes an agent used to have
   were "produce changes" or "burn retries into abandoned". When the
   premise is false the agent needs a first-class way to stop: it writes
   ``CANNOT_PROCEED_MARKER`` (inside ``.orchestrator_control/``, which is
   already excluded from commits by the git-sync artifact guards) and the
   orchestrator turns that into a failed-with-reason issue plus a tracker
   comment instead of a merge request.

A missing path is deliberately **not** a hard block: an issue may
legitimately ask for a new file to be created. The premise warning only
changes what the agent is told, never whether it runs.
