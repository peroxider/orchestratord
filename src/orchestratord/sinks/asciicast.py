"""Orchestrator adapter for asciicast recording (F-REC).

Implements the :class:`ProgressSink` protocol so it can be registered
into the per-session :class:`CompositeProgressSink` built by
``Orchestrator._build_session_sink``. Maps agent progress events into
the asciicast capture handle:

* :meth:`on_phase_complete` → ``marker("phase:{n}")`` + short text line
* :meth:`on_turn_complete`   → debug-only (turns are noisy, mirrors
  :class:`ToolContextProgressSink`'s policy)
* :meth:`on_session_complete`→ ``marker("session:{reason}")``

Per the F-REC plan we use *structured-event projection* for the
orchestrator: semantic frames instead of raw stdout mirror. The
orchestrator's :class:`StatusDashboard` already prints the rendered
view to the live console, so the recording doesn't need to duplicate
that — a navigable sequence of phase markers + session-end marker is
enough for ``asciinema play`` to show a meaningful timeline.
